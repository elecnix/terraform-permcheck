# PermCheck

**Pre-apply IAM policy validation for Terraform — cloud-agnostic.**

PermCheck ensures your Terraform deploy role has the permissions required
by **every resource** in the plan, **before** `terraform apply` touches a
single cloud API. It cross-references the plan's resource types against your
declared IAM policies using each cloud's native schema registry.

```
terraform plan -out=plan.tfplan
terraform show -json plan.tfplan | terraform-permcheck validate
```

If your deploy role is missing `kms:CreateGrant` for a `aws_backup_vault`, you
find out at plan time — not 3 failed deploys later.

## Motivation

Writing least-privilege IAM policies for a Terraform deploy role is tedious and
error-prone. Every new resource type needs its own set of API permissions, and
those permissions are scattered across AWS/GCP/Azure docs. PermCheck automates
the cross-reference:

1. Parses the `terraform plan -json` to extract every resource type being
   created, updated, or deleted.
2. Maps each terraform resource type to its cloud-native equivalent (e.g.,
   `aws_backup_vault` → `AWS::Backup::BackupVault`).
3. Fetches the required IAM permissions from the cloud's schema registry
   (CloudFormation Resource Schema for AWS, Resource Manager for GCP,
   Resource Provider schemas for Azure).
4. Diffs against your declared IAM policy documents.
5. Fails the pipeline if any required permission is missing.

### Conditional & side-effect permissions

Some permissions are only needed when a particular attribute is set. The AWS
provider, for example, makes an extra `kms:TagResource` call when an
`aws_kms_key` declares a `tags` block — a side effect that isn't part of the
primary `kms:CreateKey` action. PermCheck reads the planned attribute values
and only requires such permissions when their gating attribute is actually
present, so you neither miss them (when tags are set) nor get false positives
(when they aren't).

### Cross-service callback permissions

Some AWS APIs require an IAM action from a *different* service than the one the
Terraform provider calls. `aws_wafv2_web_acl_association` calls
`wafv2:AssociateWebACL`, but AWS WAFv2 then calls into the target service to
attach the ACL — so associating a Web ACL with an **ALB** additionally requires
`elasticloadbalancing:SetWebACL`, an **API Gateway stage** requires
`apigateway:SetWebACL`, and an **AppSync API** requires `appsync:SetWebACL`.
These callbacks are invisible to both the CloudFormation schema and the
provider source, so PermCheck adds them explicitly:

- When the target's `resource_arn` is a known ARN, only the callback for that
  ARN's service is required.
- When `resource_arn` is computed at apply time (it references a resource
  created in the same plan) or you're in static HCL mode, PermCheck can't tell
  which target applies, so it over-approximates and reports every candidate
  callback tagged `[conditional: resource_arn]`. Use `--only-required` to
  suppress that over-approximation.

## Supported clouds

| Cloud | Schema source | Status |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| **AWS** | CloudFormation Resource Schema Registry | ✅ MVP |
| **GCP** | Cloud Asset Inventory / IAM API | 🔜 planned |
| **Azure** | Resource Provider operations API | 🔜 planned |

## Usage

### CLI

```bash
# Pipe the plan JSON directly
terraform show -json plan.tfplan | terraform-permcheck validate \
  --policy-file deploy_policy.json \
  --cloud aws

# Or point at files
terraform-permcheck validate \
  --plan-file plan.json \
  --policy-file deploy_policy.json \
  --cloud aws
```

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--format` | `text` | Output format: `text` or `github-annotations` |
| `--exit-zero` | `false` | Exit 0 even when gaps are found (warn, don't fail) |

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | All permissions covered (or `--exit-zero` was set) |
| 1 | Permission gaps found (details printed to stderr) |
| 2 | Invalid input or configuration error |

### Terraform provider (planned)

```hcl
data "tf-permcheck_iam_check" "deploy_role" {
  cloud             = "aws"
  plan_file         = "plan.tfplan.json"
  policy_documents  = [
    data.aws_iam_policy_document.deploy_core.json,
    data.aws_iam_policy_document.deploy_backup.json,
  ]
}
```

## Install

```bash
go install github.com/elecnix/terraform-permcheck@latest
```

## CI integration

### Hard fail (block the PR on missing permissions)

```yaml
# .github/workflows/pr-tests.yml
- name: Check IAM permissions
  run: |
    terraform plan -out=plan.tfplan
    terraform show -json plan.tfplan | terraform-permcheck validate \
      --policy-file <(terraform output -raw deploy_policy) \
      --cloud aws
```

### Soft warn (annotate the PR diff without failing the check)

```yaml
- name: Check IAM permissions
  run: |
    terraform plan -out=plan.tfplan
    terraform show -json plan.tfplan | terraform-permcheck validate \
      --policy-file <(terraform output -raw deploy_policy) \
      --cloud aws \
      --format github-annotations \
      --exit-zero
```

With `--format github-annotations`, each missing permission group produces a
`::warning::` workflow command that GitHub Actions surfaces as a ⚠️ annotation
in the PR diff. `--exit-zero` ensures the step itself succeeds so the check
passes green while surfacing warnings.
